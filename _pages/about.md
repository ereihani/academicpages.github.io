I am an Assistant Professor at Department of Electrical and Computer Engineeing and Computer Science at California State University, Bakersfield. My research interests lie in increasing the penetration of distributed renewable energy into the power grid. I have been involved in several projects in this area when I was doing my PhD at [Renewable Energy Design Laboratory](http://manoa.hawaii.edu/me/redlab/) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I was a memebr of [Grid System Technologies Advanced Research Team](https://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/research/grid-integration) working on voltage control of distribution grid in Hawaii.
